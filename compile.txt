These are specific instructions to compile for various architectures.

DOS:
  required: DJGPP v2.8+  www.delorie.com/djgpp/ 
            NASM v0.97+
            GNU MAKE 3.75
  These are FREE resources, download links are available on the D1X website.

  -copy defines.in to defines.mak
  -edit defines.mak
   -if compiling under real dos (not in a windows dos box):
     -uncomment ENV_DJGPP_REALDOS=1
      (note: running smartdrv will likely improve performance considerably)
      (note2: if nasm dies with out of mem warning, just run it manually,
       without make taking up mem it should work.)
   -otherwise just use ENV_DJGPP=1
  -run make dep from the d1x root directory
  -run make from the d1x root directory

Windows:
  requires: NASM v0.97+
            GNU MAKE 3.77
            GCC v2.8+ (or EGCS)
             MINGW32
              ftp://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/home/janjaap/mingw32/newnew/
              (binutils,make,mingw32,win32api)
            or
             CYGWIN32
	      (Works with vers <= b20.1, but seems to have broken with the 1.1.x releases.
	      Use mingw32 unless you feel like making it work again.)
              http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin
              you also need extra mingw compatible c++ libraries at
              ftp://ftp.xraylith.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/cygwin/<ver>/<ver>-mingw-extra.tar.gz
              untar them into some dir, then put the path to it in MINGW_EXTRA.
              see http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/mno-cygwin-howto.txt for more info
            DX5 for mingw32 http://hawkins.emu.id.au/directx/
	    for OpenGL build, you also need: ftp://www.pyropilots.org/pub/d1x/wglheaders.zip
  These are FREE resources, download links are available on the D1X website.

  -copy defines.in to defines.mak
  -edit defines.mak
   -comment ENV_DJGPP = 1
   -comment the dos sound options
   -uncomment ENV_MINGW32 = 1 or ENV_CYGWIN = 1 (depending upon which you have)
   -if ENV_CYGWIN, also set MINGW_EXTRA
   -for OpenGL: uncomment WGL_IO = 1, and OGL_RUNTIME = 1
   -optional: if dx5 headers aren't in standard seach path, set DXBASE option.
  -run make dep from the d1x root directory
  -run make from the d1x root directory


Windows Direct3D:
  requires Microsoft Visual C++  www.microsoft.com/?
           DX6 SDK  www.microsoft.com/directx
  MSVC is -not- a free program. DX6 SDK is no longer a free download

  this target is depreciated.  It won't work, and when it did it behaved
    oddly.  Use the mingw32 compiler for windows versions.  Unless you
    really feel attempting to make this work.

  -copy defines.in to defines.mak
  -edit defines.mak
   -comment NO_ERROR =1
   -comment ENV_DJGPP = 1
   -comment the dos sound options
   -uncomment NO_ASM = 1
   -uncomment ENV_MSVC = 1
   -uncomment D1XD3D = 1 
   -uncomment DXBASE
   -edit the dxbase value to match your installed directx sdk directory
  -run nmake /f makefile.nt from the d1x root directory


LINUX:
  required: GCC v2.0+ (2.8+ recommended)
            NASM v0.97+
            GNU MAKE
  depending on which targets you use, one or more of these are required:
            SDL 1.1.x+   www.libsdl.org
	    svgalib 1.40  www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~zivav/
	    GGI/GII       www.ggi-project.org
  optional: The Linux Joystick Driver  (included in kernel 2.1.125+)
                        http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/
  These are FREE resources, download links are available on the D1X website.

  -ensure files were unpacked in lowercase
  -copy defines.in to defines.mak
  -edit defines.mak
   -comment ENV_DJGPP = 1
   -comment the dos sound options
   -uncomment ENV_LINUX = 1
   -uncomment GLIBC = 1 if you have GNU libC (RedHat 5.1+,Debian 2.0+)
   -uncomment appropriate targets(only one for each of video, input, and audio)
   -if you don't have /usr/include/netipx/ipx.h
     -comment HAVENETIPX = 1
  -run make dep from the d1x root directory
  -run make from the d1x root directory

  to unrar with lowercase extensions, use the -cl switch

--
The executable will be created in the d1x root directory
move it into your descent directory, and play.

Good luck.
