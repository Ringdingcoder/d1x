#caveats: 
# 1)segfaults unless you use -nosound, don't know why.
# 2)If you use X at 8bpp, it'll give lots of errors about writing to the nothing zone, I guess because in 16 bit mode it has to convert from 8bit, so it uses "local" ram instead of using DGA or whatever.
# 3)It also seems to give a fair amount of *internal errors*, again dunno why.
# 4)Longjmp seems to segfault, even though I made stubs, so there is no way to quit a game.
# 5)Very slow, may seem to be crashed while loading/playing, but its actually doing something.. just wait.
