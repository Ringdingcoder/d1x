alternate sounds
 - allow resetting altsounds within the game (menu or mission.d1x)
 - make sure linux versions work correctly
 - fix bitrate/channel/ non-allegro frequency changing (only 8b/11khz atm)

dos and/or window udp/ip

mute
non-blank init string causes modem not to work (dos only?)

co-op save game
laser/spread/plasma same as vulcan?

add uses for ingame change sync. change ban items, etc

shareware compile:
  gets broken a lot between versions, usually needs fixing.
  network code is broken, or if it does work should really be updated with all
 the fixes/additions in the registered ver.

Allegro stuff:
  autselect gives better sound ???
  allegro sucks.  add ocp if possible
  update allegro if we are going to continue using it.

Linux stuff:
  if memory allocation  checker added... mostly fixed?
  editor compile  done?
  non-x86
  windowed-mode 'disable' mouse while playing

SDL
  there might still be some obscure keys not supported
  fix broken fullscreen for SDL 0.10+
  fix broken automap for SDL 0.? (11, maybe 10)
  fix broken link for SDL 0.11 (needs -lX11 for some reason.. probably another SDL bug.. sdl-config doesn't say you need it.)

windows stuff:
  kali ipx  done? odd bugs?
  keyboard arrow keys don't work (did in 1.34) ?

WGL:
  pressing a button after res/fullscreen change causes crash.

Mingw32:
Don't use the mouse. There's a terrible bug that causes you to click
icons on your desktop behind the Descent window!

Don't use the ingame screen res changer. It crashes the game!

Sometimes it won't read your keyboard proporly.


D3D:
joystick doesn't work
Radar crashes it
Can't go to fullscreen or cockpit.
Weird, warpy effect on walls when you turn the ship
